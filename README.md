Hello and welcome to my repository. 
Here you can find the current Version and previous versions of my self made Desktop Pet.

I plan to release Version 6 till the end of August. The code is already done but I still need to make the gifs.
Version 6 will be the last Version unless there are a good amount of things to improve and add.

Have fun with your new Pet

# How to use:

1. Just download the zip folder somewhere on your PC/Laptop.
2. Unzip the folder and go to the "Desktop_Pet" folder within the "dist" folder (Versions prior to V.4 use the foldername "Desktop_Fox")
3. Right-click "Desktop_Pet.exe" and create a shortcut. Rename the shortcut as you like and put it on your Desktop.

Now you are all set to use Desktop Pet
